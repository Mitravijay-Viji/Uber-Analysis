Power BI Project: Uber Trip Analysis
Overview: This Power BI project presents an interactive and visually rich analysis of Uber trip data, designed to uncover key insights into ride patterns, operational efficiency, and revenue trends. By leveraging advanced data modelling and dynamic visuals, the dashboard enables stakeholders to explore trip volumes, fare performance, and distance metrics across various time frames and locations.
The analysis covers essential dimensions such as total trips, average fare per trip, trip distances, peak travel hours, and location-based pickup and drop-off patterns. Customized and dynamic measures and DAX calculations enhance accuracy and allow for deeper exploration, including identifying the farthest trips, busiest periods, and high-demand areas.
Project Goals
With an intuitive layout, color-coded KPIs, and interactive filters, this dashboard empowers decision-makers to:
•	Monitor overall performance at a glance.
•	Identify trends in customer demand and travel behaviour.
•	Optimize pricing and resource allocation based on data-driven insights.
Ultimately, the Uber Trip Analysis dashboard transforms raw trip data into actionable intelligence, helping improve service quality, operational planning, and strategic growth.
